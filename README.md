# Smart Distributed DC Power Management (5V 60W)
This smart distributed DC power management and charging device has the purpose to charge 5V DC battery walls and power packs from the main 220V AC line at home. The innovation of this power charging device is in the ability to schedule charging to specific times during the day and night according to the price of electricity change. It can be programmed using machine learning to connect to a electricity market data source and calculate the best time to schedule battery charging according to the price variations on the electricity markets. 


**This revision features::**
- 4 USB-C with power delivery
- 3 USB-A for fast charging up to 60W
- With 220V AC to DC converter and Power charging scheduler to allow charging only when the electricity price is lower (during the night) using machine learning algorithms.

- With a 5.0V DC two wire connector to allow DC charging from another source (for instance from solar panels)
- With a 5.0V DC two wire connector to power an indoor main DC line for all 5.0V devices and electronics (smartphones, tablets, or any other)
-With individual power consumption metrics on all USB ports (voltage, current and power )
-With detection of an empty/full "power wall" battery pack connected to one of the 3 USB-A ports

## Off the Grid usage (RV, Boats)
This smart distributed power management device can be installed and utilized off the grid, such as sail boats and motor homes. It can do battery charging when AC plug is connected (this rev. max 60W) and a max 5V DC 5A solar charging to 3 USB-A ports. Meaning one can use those commercially available 100,000mA power banks as power walls. Or a real 5V DC power wall. Any will do as long as it runs on 5V DC and is able to connect to a USB-A Port.
